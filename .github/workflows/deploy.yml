# The name of our workflow, which will appear in the "Actions" tab of your repo
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow runs automatically on any push to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or 'master' if that's your default branch

# These permissions are essential for the workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# This prevents multiple runs of the same workflow from overlapping
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  # A single job called 'deploy'
  deploy:
    # MODIFICATION: Added an environment block
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} # This will set the URL after deployment

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Define the sequence of steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code so the workflow can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment, which includes npm
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      # Step 3: Install all dependencies from package.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run the build command defined in package.json
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Configure the GitHub Pages deployment
      # MODIFICATION: Added an 'id' to this step
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages # This id is used by the environment block
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      # Step 6: Upload the 'dist' folder as a deployment artifact
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist

      # Step 7: Deploy the uploaded artifact to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
