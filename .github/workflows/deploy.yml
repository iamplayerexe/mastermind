# The name of our workflow, which will appear in the "Actions" tab of your repo

# This workflow runs automatically on any push to the 'main' branch

      - main  # Change to 'master' if that's your default branch

# These permissions are essential for the workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages

    # Use the latest version of Ubuntu as the operating environment

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code so the workflow can access it

        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20 # Use a stable version of Node.js

      # Step 3: Install all dependencies from package.json (like rimraf and cpx)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run the build command defined in package.json
      # This creates the 'dist' folder with all your website files.
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Configure the GitHub Pages deployment
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      # Step 6: Upload the 'dist' folder as a deployment artifact
      # GitHub knows to look for this artifact to serve your site.
